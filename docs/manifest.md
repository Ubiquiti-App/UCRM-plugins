## Structure

### version _(required)_
Determines version of the configuration file, for now the only possible value is "1".

### information _(required)_
Contains information describing the plugin.
- `name` - lowercase name of the plugin (can contain alphanumeric characters, dashes `-` and underscores `_`), plugin folder name is determined by this
- `displayName` - name of the plugin as displayed on UCRM frontend
- `description` - longer description of the plugin (e.g. what it does)
- `url` - link to the plugin page
- `version` - version of the plugin as displayed on UCRM frontend
- `ucrmVersionCompliancy` - defines minimum and maximum version of UCRM this plugin supports, minimum must be always defined, maximum can be `null`
- `unmsVersionCompliancy` - works the same as `ucrmVersionCompliancy` and is required for plugins to work since UNMS 1.0 (integrated version)
    - If you want to support both UCRM 2.x and UNMS 1.x, you can include both `ucrmVersionCompliancy` and `unmsVersionCompliancy` in your manifest. If you want to support only UNMS 1.0 (integrated version), do **not** include `ucrmVersionCompliancy` in your manifest.
- `author` - author of the plugin as displayed on UCRM frontend

### configuration
Determines configuration keys of the plugin. Frontend configuration form is generated from this and the values are then saved to [`data/config.json`](file-structure.md#dataconfigjson) file.

Contains an array of items. Each item is defined as follows:
- `key` - property key
- `label` - label of the property as displayed in UCRM
- `description` (optional) - description of the property, displayed under the form input in UCRM
- `required` (optional, default: `1`) - whether the property is required or optional, configuration cannot be saved without required properties
- `type` (optional, default: `text`) - type of the configuration item, will render appropriate form input in UCRM
    - available as of UCRM 2.13.0-beta1
    - possible values are:
        - `text` - standard text input
        - `textarea` - multi-line text
        - `checkbox` - true/false values
        - `choice` - dropdown list with pre-defined options (needs `choices` definition, see below)
        - `date` - date input with calendar
        - `datetime` - date and time input with calendar
        - `file` - file upload input (the file will have name based on the `key` definition, the filename will be saved in [`data/config.json`](file-structure.md#dataconfigjson) and the file itself will be saved in [`data/files`](file-structure.md#datafiles-directory) directory)
- `choices` (optional) - defines possible options for `choice` type (see manifest example above)

### menu
*Note: This feature is available since UCRM 2.14.0-beta1

Adds link(s) to the plugin into UCRM menu.

Contains an array of items. Each item is defined as follows:
- `type` - required, can have these values:
  - `"admin"` - the link will show in admin zone
  - `"client"` - the link will show in client zone
- `target` - required, can have these values:
  - `"blank"` - The link will lead simply to the target page
  - `"iframe"` - The link will lead to special page within UCRM which will show the target page in an iframe
- `key` - Menu category to insert the link into (optional)\*
- `label` - Label of the link (optional, default value is plugin name)
- `parameters` - Array of parameters for the link (optional)\*\*

\*) If `type` is `"admin"` then `"Billing"`, `"Network"`, `"Reports"` or `"System"` can be used to add the link under these existing categories in UCRM menu. In other cases a new item will be added to the menu.

\*\*) For example if `parameters` are `{"hook": "main"},` then link is `/_plugins/<plugin-name>/public.php?hook=main`.

Note: The target pages should typically be protected to be available only to authorized clients or admins. Read [this](security.md)  for details.
