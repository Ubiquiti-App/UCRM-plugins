# UCRM Client Signup
A [UCRM plugin](https://github.com/Ubiquiti-App/UCRM-plugins) that provides a frontend form for clients to signup.

_Developed by [Charuwts, LLC](https://charuwts.com)_

When installed onto UCRM the plugin public URL will display a form that anyone can enter valid info into to create a client or lead.

#### Note, only compatable with 2.14.0 and beyond

## Instructions

This plugin does not use "Execution Period" or "Execute Manually". It is designed to use the plugin public URL to post from a form and create a new Client.

There are optional params for a custom Logo, Title, Form Description and Completion Text.

- *Form Title:* Displayed below logo before form description
- *Logo URL:* Displayed above form
- *Form Description:* Displayed below logo before the form. (Can contain HTML)
- *Completion Text:* Text shown upon signup completion. (Text Only)
- *Create Lead:* Select "Yes" to create a lead instead of a client.
