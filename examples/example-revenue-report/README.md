# [Example] Revenue Report Plugin

This plugin serves as an example to show some of the possibilities of what you can do with UCRM plugins. It can be used by developers as a template for creating a new plugin.

Read more about creating your own plugin in the [Developer documentation](../../master/docs/index.md).

## Useful classes

First you can find some classes here that you can use in your own plugins.

### `App\Service\OptionsManager`

OptionsManager can be used to load the current configuration from both [ucrm.json](../../docs/file-structure.md#ucrmjson) and [config.json](../../docs/file-structure.md#dataconfigjson). The data are returned in form of `App\Data\UcrmData` and `App\Data\PluginData` respectively.

### `App\Service\UcrmApi`

UcrmApi is used to simplify the calls to [UCRM API](https://ucrm.docs.apiary.io). There are 3 methods:

- `command` - to call a POST, PATCH or DELETE endpoint
- `query` - to call a GET endpoint
- `getUser` - to retrieve data about the current user to verify [security](../../docs/security.md)

### `App\Service\TemplateRenderer`

Very simple class to load a PHP template. When writing a PHP template be careful to use correct escaping function: `echo htmlspecialchars($string, ENT_QUOTES);`.

## Google Charts example

This plugin also renders the data as a very simple chart using the [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) JavaScript library.
